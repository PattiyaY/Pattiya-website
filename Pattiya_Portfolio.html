        <h1>Pattiya Yiadram</h1>
        <p>My major at Assumption University is computer science. 
            Despite my inexperience, I have learnt a few coding languages, including Python, C, HTML, and CSS. 
            When I was in the seventh grade, I started learning the C programming language. 
            I started learning HTML and CSS on my own when I was 17 years old.
            I'm currently learning Python, a fourth programming language.
            I'm a hardworking, patient, enjoy solving the problems and calm.
            Lastly, I'm constantly eager to learn new things</p>
        <h1>Why I want to be a part of Dcode</h1>
        <p>Basically, Backend Developer is my area of interest. I would say that this is an excellent opportunity to
            collaborate and exchange ideas with my friends and coding experts.
            I want to develop my abilities. It would be wonderful to be a part of Dcode so that I could learn more and
            receive excellent advise from people with experience. This opportunity can lead me to great future.</p>
